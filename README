RPi-OS is a simple operating system for the Raspberry Pi. Its goal is to 
provide a basis on which applications can be built that do not require 
the support of a full operating system such as Linux. 

Secondarily, it keeps me entertained on rainy days, of which there are 
a lot in The Netherlands...

Currently, the following parts are implemented and mostly stable:

- Cooperative multitasking, including timed waits, mutexes and events
- System clock with pluggable system tick event handlers
- Different time bases (usec, msec, and sec) to deal with uint32_t wrapping
- Pluggable interrupt handler system
- PL011 UART
- On-board LED
- API written in C
- Full support for C++, including global instance initialization

Time permitting, I'll be adding support for the different on-board devices, 
USB and graphics (I'll first have to hook up a monitor though...).

RPi-OS currently only supports the RPi-B+, mostly because I don't have any 
other versions to develop or test on.

Many thanks for the amazing ground work done by:

- Brian, who's Bare Metal Programming tutorial has been my starting point
  for the RPi (http://www.valvers.com/open-software/raspberry-pi/)
- Goswin von Brederlow, author of raspbootin, the UART bootloader that has
  saved my RPi and SD card from breaking down after so many reboots:

- All of the amazing people on the RPi forum that have figured out all of
  the nitty-gritty details of the RPi:
