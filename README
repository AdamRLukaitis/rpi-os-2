RPi-OS is a simple operating system for the Raspberry Pi. Its goal is to provide a basis on which applications can be built 
that do not require the support of a full operating system such as Linux. Secondarily, it keeps me entertained on rainy
days, of which there are a lot in this country...

Currently, the following parts are implemented and mostly stable:

- Cooperative multitasking, including timed waits, mutexes and events
- System clock with pluggable system tick event handlers
- Different time bases (usec, msec, and sec) to deal with uint32_t wrapping
- Pluggable interrupt handler system
- PL011 UART
- On-board LED

Time permitting, I'll be adding support for the different on-board devices, USB and graphics (I'll first have to hook up
a monitor though...).

RPi-OS currently only supports the RPi-B+, mostly because I don't have any other versions to develop or test on.
